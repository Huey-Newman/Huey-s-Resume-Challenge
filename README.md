# Huey-s-Resume-Challenge
The Cloud Resume Challenge is a multiple-step resume project that helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career as a Cloud Engineer. The Cloud Resume Challenge was a unique, challenging, and relevant project to add to my portfolio, host my resume, and demonstrate a variety of skills employers look for in applicants. The challenge not only requires you to build a resume programmatically, using HTML and CSS, but also host that resume, integrate a database backend, connect resources serverless, and implement industry best practices through automation and infrastructure as code. The Challenge Components include:

1. Get Certification
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Static S3 Website
5. DNS
6. Javascript
7. API
8. Lambda Function
9. WAF
10. Dynamodb
11. Cloudwatch
12. Python
13. AWS CLI
14. Infrastructure as Code(I chose Terraform because it was agnostic)
15. CI/CD (Back End)
16. CI/CD (Front End

I've been working on my serverless website resume through terraform using IAM roles and policies, s3 buckets, cloudfront, ACM, cloudwatch, Route 53. lambda functions, Rest Api gateway and DynamoDB. The hit counter on the side on the orange strip at the bottom is powered by the Rest Api gateway, lambda, and dynamodb. I used cloudwatch and the third party Postman to mitigate my api and lambda errors through the cloudshell command line as shown below as Exhibit A. This creates a serveless web application. In this case, a resume was created. The logic and diagram is above. You can view my resume at https://resumeforhuey.click Exhibit A
