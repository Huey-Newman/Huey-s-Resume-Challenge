# Huey-s-Resume-Challenge
The Cloud Resume Challenge is a multiple-step resume project that helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career as a Cloud Engineer. The Cloud Resume Challenge was a unique, challenging, and relevant project to add to my portfolio, host my resume, and demonstrate a variety of skills employers look for in applicants.

The Challenge Components include:

1. Get Certification
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Static S3 Website
5. DNS
6. Javascript
7. API
