# Huey-s-Resume-Challenge
The Cloud Resume Challenge is a multiple-step resume project that helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career as a Cloud Engineer. The Cloud Resume Challenge was a unique, challenging, and relevant project to add to my portfolio, host my resume, and demonstrate a variety of skills employers look for in applicants. The challenge not only requires you to build a resume programmatically, using HTML and CSS, but also host that resume, integrate a database backend, connect resources serverless, and implement industry best practices through automation and infrastructure as code. The Challenge Components include:

Get Certification
HTML
CSS
Static S3 Website
DNS
JavaScript
API
Lambda Function
WAF
Dynamodb
Cloudwatch
Python
AWS CLI
Tests
Infrastructure as Code(I chose Terraform because it was agnostic)
